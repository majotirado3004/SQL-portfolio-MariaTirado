Achievement 3 – Rockbuster Stealth

This repository includes the SQL queries and analysis I developed during Achievement 3 of my Data Analytics program.

## 📌 Overview
I worked with the Rockbuster Stealth movie rental database to:
- Explore customer behavior
- Identify high-value markets
- Analyze rental patterns
- Answer business questions for the marketing and strategy teams

The project used PostgreSQL and covered:
- Data cleaning
- JOINs (inner, left, right)
- Subqueries
- Aggregations (GROUP BY, HAVING)
- CTEs
- Window functions

You will find a selection of my most relevant SQL queries inside the `/queries` folder.  
These demonstrate my ability to write clean, professional SQL for business analytics.
